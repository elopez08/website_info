                I'm Merable.  I'm a streamer on Twitch.tv.  My main objective is to provide entertainment.  If I look like a fool, it matters not!  My mission is to make YOU laugh and smile.  So enjoy your time as I dive myself into unknown territory... or perhaps a HEATED territory involving rank games.  OOOOF x.x
